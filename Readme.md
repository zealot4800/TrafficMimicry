# Traffic Mimicry System

This project is designed to apply adversarial transformations to network traffic captures (PCAP files). The goal is to modify the statistical features of the traffic to mimic a different type of traffic, effectively obfuscating its original signature. This is useful for testing the robustness of traffic classifiers and for research into network privacy and security.

## Core Transformation Scripts

The main components of this system are the `pcap_transformer_*.py` scripts located in `src/mimicaryModel/`. Each script is specialized to transform input PCAP files to match the statistical profile of a specific traffic category.

### Transformation Strategy

The core strategy for each script is as follows:

1.  **Feature-Driven Transformations**: Each script contains a `FEATURE_IMPORTANCE` dictionary that assigns a weight to various traffic features (e.g., packet length, inter-arrival time). These weights determine which transformations are prioritized.
2.  **Progressive Application**: The script iteratively applies transformations (like padding, splitting, and introducing delays) to the PCAP data.
3.  **SLA Compliance**: After each transformation, the script checks if the modified traffic complies with a set of Service Level Agreement (SLA) constraints defined for the target traffic type.
4.  **Bypass for Non-Compliant Sources**: A key aspect of the strategy is that the scripts will attempt to transform traffic *even if the source file is already outside the SLA constraints*. The goal is to mold non-compliant traffic *into* a compliant state, rather than rejecting it outright.

### How to Run

All transformation scripts follow the same command-line structure.

**General Usage:**

```bash
python src/mimicaryModel/<script_name>.py <input_pcap_directory> <output_pcap_directory> --recommended
```

-   `<script_name>.py`: The specific transformer script to use.
-   `<input_pcap_directory>`: The directory containing the original PCAP files.
-   `<output_pcap_directory>`: The directory where the modified PCAP files will be saved.

1.  **Transform PCAPs**: Use a `pcap_transformer_*.py` script to generate a set of modified PCAP files.
2.  **Convert to CSV**: Run `run_cicflowmeter.py` on the output directory from the previous step to extract flow features.
3.  **Evaluate Model**: Use `evaluate_nonvpn_model.py` (or a similar evaluation script) with the generated CSV and a pre-trained model to see how the transformed traffic is classified.
4.  **Prepare for Retraining**: Use `split_csv_train_test.py` to prepare the new dataset for training or retraining classification models.
